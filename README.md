## A Data Scraping Adventure in the World of Airbnb Ratings
The objective of this project is to extract data from Airbnb's website in order to understand the
factors that impact Airbnb ratings. We scraped data from the Airbnb website for three different
states and captured details on factors such as price, discount, amenities, location, ratings, and
superhost status. We then stored this data in MongoDB for further analysis.

The project aims to help travelers make more informed decisions when selecting Airbnb
properties by providing insights into what factors contribute to high ratings. Additionally, this
project can provide guidance to Airbnb hosts on how to improve their ratings by focusing on the
factors that matter most to guests.

Overall, the project demonstrates the power of web scraping and data analysis in unlocking
valuable insights about the travel industry and helping both guests and hosts make more
informed decisions.
